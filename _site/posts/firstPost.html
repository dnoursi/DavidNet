<p>Today I finally made my website, where I can catalog things I’ve been working on. As I write this post, I’m transitioning computers, and have been putting some things up on github to help with the transition process. Working with Hakyll, this interesting library, has been on my hit list for some time now, so I decided to batch it with the other things I’m putting on github after putting in some effort.</p>
<p>In recent years, I have noticed the peculiar number of successful <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/">mathematicians</a> and <a href="http://norvig.com/">programmers</a> who seem to have sites such as this. This site is a part of my compulsive immitation of those elderly people I respect. Moreso, these types of sites are highly touted by the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/about">Recurse Center</a> in particular, and I’m willing to take their advice on their merit alone; RC is a hell of a place which I would love to be a part of in the near future.</p>
