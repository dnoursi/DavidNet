title: About
---

I'm mainly interested in Math, but I also like computer science and other theoretical things. Since coming to UChicago, I've begun working at the <a href="https://csil.cs.uchicago.edu">Computer Science Instructional Lab</a> as a tutor. I've also joined the Scaffold research group with professor Fred Chong.
