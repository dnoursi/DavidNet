title: About
---

I'm mainly interested in Math, but I also like computer science, politics, and really anything I can learn from a book. Since coming to UChicago, I've been working with the <a href="https://github.com/epiqc/ScaffCC">Scaffold research group</a>, headed by professor Fred Chong. My first year, I worked at the <a href="https://politics.uchicago.edu">Institute of Politics</a> with former St. Louis Police Chief and chair of the Ferguson Commission, Dan Isom, and I work at the <a href="https://csil.cs.uchicago.edu">Computer Science Instructional Lab</a> as a tutor.
