Today I finally made my website, where I can
catalog things I've been working on.
As I write this post, I'm transitioning computers, and have
been putting some things up on github to help with the transition
process. Working with Hakyll, this interesting library, has been
on my hit list for some time now, so I decided to batch it with 
the other things I'm putting on github after putting in some effort.

In recent years, I have noticed the peculiar number
of successful [mathematicians](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/) and
[programmers](http://norvig.com/) who seem to have sites such as
this. This site is a part of my compulsive immitation of 
those elderly people I respect.
Moreso, these types of sites are highly touted by the
[Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/about) in particular, and I'm
willing to take their advice on their merit alone; RC is a hell of a place
which I would love to be a part of in the near future.
